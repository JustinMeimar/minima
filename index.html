        <p class="bio">
	I'm a undergraduate student at the University of Alberta studying computer science.
	My primary focus involves systems (Compilers, OS, networking etc).

	I enjoy snooping around the hardware software boundary, making bash scripts, as well as trees -- both real and upside down ones.
	<br></br>
	<p class="bio">
	Afer several complex portfolio sites, I've finally decide to drop it all in favour of a single html and css file each.
	At one point I had a homeserver open on 443 serving a sandboxed environment into my CLI projects.
	While it was a fun experience, software should be simple -- right? (I also got tired of hearing the my computer fan while trying to sleep.)
