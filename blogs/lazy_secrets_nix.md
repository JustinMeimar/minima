# Lazy Secrets in Nix

> Lazy as in evaluation, secrets as in don't leak 'em.  

I have been enamoured with the idea of a fully declarative home server since being introduced to Nix about a year ago. Perhaps it is just me, but I have a general fear of forgetting how I've set things up. Especially with server management, when bespoke configuration files are often tucked away in the nooks and crannies of `/etc`.

For me Nix offers a cure to my forgetting of an `nginx` configuration file format, or where to put an `SSL` certificate. Not that either of those problems are unsolvable, but switching hardware will bring about a monsoon of configuration details I would rather avoid. Learning Nix has been a battle, and to say I have "learnt Nix" is a vast overstatement, but in any case, I recently learned something cool about secrets and the Nix expression language's _lazy_ nature the other day, so I wanted to share it here.

### Secrets

We all have secrets, personal and cryptographic alike, and it is a good idea to keep them hidden. My secret management problem started when I learned that `ssh-keygen` will cause a collision with the last key I named `id_rsa`... Since then, there was a time when my `~/.ssh` was considerably cluttered. A good consistent naming scheme I find goes a long way, however, the issue of duplicating secrets across multiple machines (my laptop, desktop, work computer and university lab machines for example) necessitated a more dexterous secret management system. That is where I've found `sops-nix` useful.

### Sops and Secrets

[Sops](https://google.ca) is a project for managing secrets. It exists independently of Nix, and `sops-nix` is the NixOS module for configuring `sops` declaratively. The basic workflow for using `sops-nix` is as follows.

1. Create a monolithic `secrets.yaml` file somewhere locally. For example, an excerpt of mine looks like:
```yaml
cloudflare-dydns-token: |
  CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=cf-token

nix-github-token: |
  gh-token
```

2. Create a `key.age` keypair locally to produce an encrypted `secrets.yaml.enc` which can be stored in your Nix configuration repository. (I put mine adjacent to `sops.nix`.)
```bash
sops --encrypt \
     --age "$(cat nix.age.pub)" \
     ./secrets.yaml > ./secrets.yaml.enc 
```

3. Set up the `sops-nix` module something like below.
```nix
  sops = {
    age.keyFile = "/home/justin/.secrets/nix.age";
    defaultSopsFile = ./secrets.yaml.enc;
    secrets = {
      cloudflare-dydns-token = {
        mode = "0600";
      };
      github-token = {
        path = "/home/justin/.ssh/nix-github-token";
        mode = "0600";
      };
      # one entry for each secret
    };
  };
```

When building your configuration, sops will read in the encrypted secrets file, unlock each secret with the `.age` key and write it into the specified file path. If the `path` attribute is not specified, the secret will automatically be written to `/run/secrets` on NixOS and `~/.nix-profile/secrets/` with standalone Nix.

> Note: This doesn't solve the "duplicate your secrets with scp" problem entirely. It reduces it to a maximum copy of two: one for the age key, one for the encrypted secrets. It is progress, but maybe there is a better solution for this.

### Laziness

Once `sops-nix` is configured, you may be asking - doesn't having a monolithic `secrets.yaml` mean my secrets will be duplicated _in full_ on all my machines? Probably best for work secrets to be isolated. Work secrets remain on work machines, similarly for personal secrets. This is where the lazy evaluation of Nix is perfect. When building your configuration, `sops-nix` will only ever write out the secret to a file _if it is referenced in another attribute_. In other words, secrets are produced at runtime, on demand - i.e. lazily.

For example, I only ever need my CloudFlare dynamic DNS token on one server. So long as `sops.secrets.cloudflare-dydns-token` is only referenced in this server's configuration, it will never be evaluated on others. My homeserver is called `bee` (because it is a BeeLink U59).
```nix
// bee.nix
{ config, pkgs, ... }:

{
  imports = [
    ../modules/nixos/base.nix
    ../programs/sops/sops.nix
  ];

  services.cloudflare-dyndns = {
    enable = true;
    domains = [ "justinmeimar.com"];
    apiTokenFile = config.sops.secrets.cloudflare-dydns-token.path;
    proxied = false;
  };
}
```

Now, if I ever want to switch the hardware for my home-server, all I have to do is install Nix, copy over some secrets, and a systemd service to manage dynamic DNS will set itself up instantly!

#### Conclusion

I'm not an expert on Nix, but if you aren't either, I hope this may have given you an impression of what is possible, and why the declarative dream is a beautiful one. This is my first blog, so thank you for reading this far!
